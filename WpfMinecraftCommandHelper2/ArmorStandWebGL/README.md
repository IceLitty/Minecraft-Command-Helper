Minecraft Armor Stand (Translated to Chinese and offlined it)
=================

###[Try it out(Original)](http://haselkern.github.io/Minecraft-ArmorStand)

In Minecraft 1.8 Armorstands were introduced. Unfortunately, the syntax to summon one is quite confusing and not very intuitive, especially when you're trying to create an awesome pose. This tool provides a graphical interface, so that you can focus on the looks and not worry about code.

If you would like to see a feature implemented, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Minecraft 盔甲架 (翻译至中文并完全离线化)
=================

###[试试看？(汉化后项目)](https://icelitty.github.io/Minecraft-ArmorStand/)

在Minecraft1.8版本开始有了盔甲架这东西。很不幸的，召唤指令特别的复杂，不是那么的清晰明了，尤其是你想自己捏一个好看的姿势。此工具创建了一个图形界面，让您倾心于捏姿势而不必担心繁杂的代码（其实和[MCH](https://github.com/IceLitty/Minecraft-Command-Helper)一样啦）。

如果你想提交你希望实现的功能，请在[原帖](https://github.com/haselkern/Minecraft-ArmorStand)中推送更新。
